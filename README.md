# yolo_spermdetection
Automatically annotate sperm cells in phase contrast microscope videos of male ejaculate using yolov5. 

Training dataset for this yolo model was obtained from 5 different videos taken using Keyence all in one fluorescence microscope. Frames were extracted using imageJ (NIH) and annotated using roboflow.

Figure 1 shows the results from pilot training dataset. We are working on making a bigger training dataset which will include over 40 species belonging to fish family poecilidae.
